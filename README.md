Pt3 Problem1: It is not appropriate to use a unit test to test "message" feature of a messaging application. Since message function invovles multiple components and might require external system. In this case, unit test is not enough to test this function because unit test need the code be isolated and simple functionality.

Pt3 Problem2: It is appropriate to use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application. Since max message length is a simple and isolated functionality and no external dependence. Therefore, unit test is a good way to test it.
